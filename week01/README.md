## Week 1: Introduction to Linux
1. `cd week01`
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. `ssh ritsec@localhost -p12345 (password is ritsec)`

#### Hints:
All flags will be in the format of `RS{flag_goes_here}`\
Easy 1: Where are system usernames stored?\
Easy 2: hackerman1337 is hiding the flag in his home directory!\
Medium 1: I wish I could find my flag... (format is flag.txt)\
Medium 2: Login as the hard user! Some lazy sysadmin forget to clear their history...\
Hard: What's in hard.txt?

### TODO:
This is broken because I did not push the dotfiles, therefore the compose breaks. Oops. Will be fixed soon^TM
